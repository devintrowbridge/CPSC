    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> DISCUSSION <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

    In many ordered collections that are implemented based on arrays, a major
    issue is the cost associated with shifting elements to the right when
    adding and to the left when removing.

    For example, let's say that we're implementing a list that keeps its
    elements in natural order using an array using our familiar "left
    justified" strategy. If the array has capacity 10 and the list contains
    the first five odd integers, then the array would look like this:

        [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, _, _, _, _, _]

    Adding the value 4 to the list would require elements 5, 7, and 9 to be
    shifted to the right

        [1, 3, _, 5, 7, 9, _, _, _, _]

    to make room for the 4 to be added in natural order:

        [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, _, _, _, _]

    This test question asks you to write the code to shift elements to the
    right in an array.


    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> INSTRUCTIONS <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

    1.  Read through this entire class to make sure you understand the context.
        The only method you must complete is the method named shiftRight below.
        The shiftRight method takes two parameters. The first (array) is the
        containing the elements to be shifted. The second (index) is the starting
        index of the shift. For example, to go from the original array above to
        the shifted version (the second illustration) we could call shiftRight(a, 2).

    2.  A sample main method is provided for you to illustrate the intended
        effect of calls to the shiftRight method.

    3.  Once you have read through all the provided source code, your task is
        to provide a correct implementation of the shiftRight method at the very
        bottom of this file.

    4.  Your grade will be solely determined by the percentage of test cases that
        your submitted code passes.
